Use after making code changes, when docs may be stale, or when the user says things like \"check the docs\", \"are the docs up to date\", \"factcheck\", \"audit docs\", \"verify documentation\", or \"docs are wrong\"."

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). It may specify which docs to check, specific areas of concern, or files to focus on.

## Purpose

Deep factcheck of project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, SVG diagrams, and skill/agent definitions) against the actual codebase. Finds inaccuracies, stale references, missing information, and bloat. Produces a report and then applies fixes.

**Audience distinction:**
- **README.md** is for humans setting up and using Rockport. It should explain what things do and how to use them.
- **CLAUDE.md** is for Claude Code. It should document non-obvious gotchas, exact technical details, and things that would trip up an AI assistant working on the codebase. Don't duplicate what's readable from code.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Build ground truth from code

Read ALL source-of-truth files listed in [sources.md](sources.md). Do not skip any. Use the Agent tool with subagent_type=Explore or parallel Read calls to maximise speed.

### Phase 2: Cross-reference and audit

For each documentation file, check EVERY factual claim against the ground truth gathered in Phase 1. Be methodical — go line by line through each doc file. Use the checklists in [checklists.md](checklists.md).

### Phase 3: Report findings

Present ALL findings in a table. Be exhaustive — every discrepancy matters.

```
| # | File | Location | Type | Description | Fix |
|---|------|----------|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | README.md | L42 | STALE | References /v1/images/structure (removed) | Remove row |
| 2 | CLAUDE.md | L108 | INACCURATE | Says MemoryMax 512MB, systemd has 256MB | Change to 256MB |
| 3 | arch.svg | sidecar box | MISSING | No stability-* models shown | Add model box |
| 4 | CLAUDE.md | L95,L107 | DUPLICATE | Tunnel routing described twice | Remove one |
```

Issue types:
- **STALE** — references something that no longer exists in code
- **INACCURATE** — states something that contradicts the code
- **MISSING** — omits something important that exists in code
- **BLOAT** — unnecessary verbosity or over-documentation of obvious things
- **DUPLICATE** — same fact stated multiple times
- **INCONSISTENT** — two doc files contradict each other about the same fact

After presenting the table, ask: "Shall I apply all fixes?" and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Apply fixes

After user confirms, apply all fixes:
- **STALE**: remove or update the reference
- **INACCURATE**: correct to match code exactly
- **MISSING**: add in the appropriate location (README for users, CLAUDE.md for Claude)
- **BLOAT**: remove the unnecessary content
- **DUPLICATE**: keep the better version, remove the other
- **INCONSISTENT**: use the version that matches code, fix the other

### Phase 5: Verify

After applying fixes:
1. Run `shellcheck` on any modified `.sh` files
2. Run `terraform -chdir=terraform fmt -check` if terraform files were touched
3. Run `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('file').read())"` on any modified `.py` files
4. Validate modified SVGs are well-formed XML: `python3 -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('file.svg')"`
5. Run `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/litellm-config.yaml'))"` if config was touched
6. Show a git diff summary of all changes made

## Rules

### No bloat (CRITICAL)

- **Only document what is needed and accurate. Be succinct.** Don't add prose, context, or background that doesn't help the reader do something or avoid a mistake.
- **State facts, not explanations.** "Stability AI image edit models use the `us.` cross-region inference prefix" is good. "Because Stability AI models on Bedrock are only available through cross-region inference profiles, which route requests across multiple US regions for improved availability, the model IDs must include the `us.` prefix" is bloat.
- **If the current wording is accurate, leave it alone.** Don't rephrase working descriptions.
- **CLAUDE.md litmus test:** "Would Claude make a mistake without this bullet?" If no, delete it.
- **README.md should be scannable.** Tables over paragraphs. Bullet points over prose. Code examples over descriptions.

### Source of truth

- **Code is the single source of truth** — if docs and code disagree, docs are wrong
- **Every claim must be verifiable** — if you can't find it in the code, it shouldn't be in the docs
- **Precision over prose** — use exact model names, exact paths, exact ports, exact error codes

### Audience

- **README.md is for humans** — explain what things do and how to use them
- **CLAUDE.md is for Claude** — document non-obvious gotchas and constraints that would cause mistakes. Don't document things readable from code
- **No duplication across files** — don't repeat the same fact in both unless the audiences genuinely need different framing

### SVG diagrams

- **SVGs must render correctly** — every edit must produce valid XML. After any SVG edit, validate with `python3 -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('file.svg'); print('valid')"` before moving on
- **Do not rewrite SVGs** — make targeted text edits only. Changing a `<text>` element's content is fine. Restructuring layout, moving boxes, or adding new elements risks breaking coordinates and alignment. Only add/move SVG elements if you can verify the coordinates are correct by examining adjacent elements
- **SVG text must match code exactly** — routing descriptions, port numbers, model names, memory limits must all come from the source-of-truth files read in Phase 1
- **Test SVG rendering** — if any SVG was modified, after all fixes are applied open it in a browser or viewer to check it renders without overlapping text or broken layout. If you can't open a viewer, at minimum validate XML and check that no coordinates were accidentally changed

### Cleanup

- **Remove stale feature-branch annotations** — bullets ending in "(009-complete-image-services)" or similar should be cleaned up once merged
- **Active Technologies should list only current tech** — no feature-branch-specific entries
- **Remove dead references** — any mention of endpoints, files, or features that no longer exist must be removed, not just updated
